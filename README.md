# Past Deserts

I started baking more towards the end of 2024 and really enjoyed making sweets for my friends and family. It quickly became a hobby, and I wanted a way to remember each recipe. This website serves as a memory log that grows every time I bake something new. I included a link to the recipe I followed, photos of how my version turned out, and notes about anything I learned or wanted to mention during the baking process.
