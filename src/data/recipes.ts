            "I think the hardest part about this recipe was looking for the jam and extract. I managed to find the jam at ranch 99 and the extract suprisingly at Walmart.

            "So the color from mixing was amazing but after cooking, it wasn't looking so good. I don't know why but I tend to overcook everything. Maybe i'm just scared that i'll die from raw ingredients? The top of the brownies was a bit hard and it turned into like a dark brown color. " +

So I cooked it for about 8 more minutes and that was a big mistake! <br/><br/>" +
            "They turned out pretty hard but if you pop it in the microwave they did get softer. The middle part was kind of fudgey making it nice and gooey. I also tried the trick of putting a tortilla in the tub with the cookies to make them softer. The reason behind it was becasue the tortilla would suck up all of the moisture, making the cookies softer. This apparently works good with bread too but I didn't have any. I'm pretty sure the tortilla trick work but it wasn't as soft because I kept the cookies in the fridge for some reason.<br/><br/>" +

Originally I was going to make an oreo one but I thought matcha strawberry sounded better. Plus I wanted to make another matcha desert. <br/><br/>" +
            "So the matcha I used is just a random tub from amazon but it super big and it only cost $25. I don't think it was ceremonial matcha but it still gets the job done. The color was definetly darker and the taste wasn't as strong but it's still good. <br/><br/>" +
            "One interesting thing I learned is that ceremonial matcha is actaully a lighter color. I noticed that some of the recipes used ceremonial matcha that's why the color of my matcha cake was much darker than the pictures in the recipe. But I just wanted something in my budget. A small tub of cerermonial matcha was like $40." + 
            "It's worth if you tend to go out and buy a lot of matcha drinks since those run for $6-$10. Anways if you want a good matcha flavor then ceremonial is the way to go. <br/><br/>" +

I baked it for 8 more minutes and it turned out perfect. But then I left it in the oven to cool down and it slowly baked more which made it a little overcooked. Doesn't matter though in a tres leches recipe." +
            "Also when decorating the cake I did do the powered style to make it look pretty but there was a big clump so I tried scooping it out but it made the cake look ugly. So I just combined the powder and whipped and it didn't look as bad. You can see it in the third picture before I put on the strawberries. " +

Considering the tres leches was for him .Also again for the milks it's just a combination of evaporated, condensed, and whole milk. I added red dye to mine so that the whipped was pink colored.

            "For anyone that does try out the recipe I reccomend cooking it for less time or using a smaller cooking pan so that it doesn't look as thin. <br/><br/>" +
            "One thing I really liked was the frosting. So it did taste a bit sour and because of the greek yogurt taste but other than that it was super good. I didn't expect it at all. For the frosting I used <strong> greek yogurt, cream cheese, and monkfruit. </strong> Monkfruit is 0 cals which is really nice and it makes a good sweetener. The combination of these three made such a gooey and sweet frosting. It was superrr good. <br/><br/>" +
            "Overall, I rate this recipe a <strong> 8/10. </strong> The taste was there and the frosting but I just diddn't like the cooking times he reccomended. I know it's a brownie so it should be thinner but the one in his video looked super moist and think. I just wish he gave a heads up on the cooking pan or reduced the cooking time so that it doesn't overbake. "

            "The batter made around I think 24ish muffins. One thing to note is that you should have enough of the tin cupcake holders.

            "So the first thing I messed up on was combining the dry and wet ingredients. Usually you want to stir the wet and the dry separaetly THEN combine them. I was talking to Shawn while I was baking so I totally forgot. The next mistake was not sfiting the matcha. A lot of clumbs can be seen in the batter and it looked nasty. You could also somewhat taste it. <br/><br/>" +
            "Also my mixture was super watery. I am not sure if that is how it is suppose to be or if it's because I mix they dry and wet early but I added extra flour. I think that ruined it because the brochie does taste a little powdery but it could also be the matcha too. Also brochie = brownie + mochi. I thought it sounded weird but that's what the recipe called it. <br/><br/>" +
            "Overall, the brochie still turned out yummy. They weren't horrible but they also weren't amazing. I give this recipe a 10/10. I do think it would have been way better if I had better matcha and I didn't mess up. The inside turned out so pretty though I really like it. "

            "At first my dough didn't look that smooth so I was a bit worried but I just needed to massage it more. After letting it sit for a bit once you start kneading it, the dough will smooth out. <br/><br/>" +
            "The recipe made a total of 16+ cinnamon rolls but I also had a bit of extra that I tossed because it was the end parts. I think I also cut the rolls too thin so they needed to be a litte bit bigger, but they puffed up to a really good size. They actually puffed up more than I expected. They kind of looked like a nipple after I baked it but it still held the swirl design. <br/><br/>" +
            "In the first picture I did two separate frostings. The one on the right is a standard frosting with the cream cheese, milk, and sugar. The recipe called for butter but I didn't add any since I used a lot of butter in the recipe already. The other frosting was a protein frosting that I made last time for the oreo brownies and swiss rolls. It consisted of yogurt, sugar, and cream cheese. Super good but it does taste slighty sour due to the yogurt. <br/><br/>" +
            "Overall, this recipe was fun to make. It was definetly different from the other stuff I made because you mix, wait, then bake. It was just something different from the usual deserts I bake."
