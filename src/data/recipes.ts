        "description": "I used strawberry protein powder instead of chocolate. It was really good especially with the white chocolate chips. But according to Eman it ain't a brownie if it ain't chocolate. So I made strawberry cake that day? Also did not take a picture of the ones I made.",

        "description": "Turn out really good. It only takes around 3 minutes for the jelly to solidify before pouring the next layer. A little annoying to make because the jelly and solidify again after boiling so you need to boil it again.",

        "description": "Overcooked the brownies so the top layer was a little bit hard. Make sure to not overcook because when you let it cool it will still slowly cook a little. It tasted super good cold because it was chunk rather than it being crumbly when you reheat it. Super easy to make and following along with the recipe.",
