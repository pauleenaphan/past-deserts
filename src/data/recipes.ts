            "Pandan Jelly consist of pandan and coconut. The process was easy but also a bit frustrating. So I had to boil the coconut jelly and pandan then you pour each layer while waiting for the previous layer to solidify." +
            "The annoying part was that sometimes the layer would take a while to solidify, so the jelly in the pot would solidify while I was waiting. Which is okay since you can boil it to make it jelly again. I had to boil it 3 extra times. " +
            "It wasn't my favorite running in and out of Bun's backyard reboiling the jelly.<br/> <br/>" +
            "I did overboil the rest of the pandan so some of it went to waste. It was okay though since the container didn't have anymore space for the layers. So it wasn't a lost cause. <br/> <br/>" + 
            "The jelly came out looking really good. The layers were sticking and the shape really solidify. I don't like jelly so I made it for Buns since he was craving it. Btw he made Bun Bo Hue that day it was yummy. <br/> <br/>" +
            "Even though I don't like jelly I would give this recipe a <strong>8/10</strong>. It was easy to make but annoying since I had to reboil the layers when they solidify, but it was fun pouring the layers and seeing it jiggle."

            "I give this recipe a <strong>9/10</strong>. Only because I don't really like eating my blueberries in full form. Maybe it would have been good too if I squashed up the blueberries so the cheesecake would have been a dark blue color. Who knows?"

            "I think the hardest part about this recipe was looking for the jam and extract. I managed to find the jam at ranch 99 and the extract suprisingly at Walmart. It could also be found at another vietnamese store but I can't remember the name. The Hmart near me did not have any of these items.<br/><br/>" +
            "The jam gave it flavor, but the extract gave it so much color and much more flavor. Mixing it was my favorite part because the color turned out so nicely. I also like licking the spoon when I am finished mixing.<br/><br/>" +
            "So the color from mixing was amazing but after cooking, it wasn't looking so good. I don't know why but I tend to overcook everything. Maybe i'm just scared that i'll die from raw ingredients? The top of the brownies was a bit hard and it turned into like a dark brown color. " +
            "The chocolate chip also turned into a nasty yellow looking color. One thing I learned is that it's okay to take it out a <strong>little early because it will still slowly cook while it's super hot</strong>.<br/><br/>" +

Though the bottom of the pastries were cooked but not super flaky as I would want it to be. I looked it up and it says foil isn't the best because it can distribute heat rather than hold it. So it could lead to uneven cooking. <br/><br/>" +
