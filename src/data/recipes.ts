            "This Banana Pudding consisted of whip, bananas, nilla crackers and sweet stuff. The recipe was super easy to make and it was a nonbaked recipe.<br/><br/>" +
            "All I had to do was prep the pudding the night before, whip the heavy cream, then create the layers. I got these mini containers from daiso and made mini banana pudding jars.<br/><br/>" +
            "I remember during this day my ear drum actually bursted due to too much ear pressure building up in my right ear from my back to back flight from Europe. It really hurt but banana pudding somewhat saved the day. " +
            "I gave out a mini jar to Eman, Erick, and Bun. They all seemed to like it!.<br/><br/>" +
            "Patrick actually sent me this recipe. The other night he brought a tub home and it was really good. So I asked for the recipe to make it myself.<br/><br/>" +
            "Overall, I rate this recipe <strong>10/10</strong>. It was super easy to make and turned out really good. Seems hard to mess it up."

            "I accidentally overcooked them a bit so the top was ugly and brown. Surprsingly it wasn't that dry. It kind of just tasted like cake with a hint of strawberry. Well everyone seemed to like it, so the bake was a win.<br/><br/>" +
            "Instead of doing chocolate I wanted to do strawberry because I had strawberry protein powder. I also used white chocolate chips instead. The white chocolate chips definetly added way more flavor than I thought.<br/><br/>" +
            "I was kind of sad when I overcooked the cake because the batter was a super nice pink color. It was stil pink inside a little but it wasn't the color I wanted. I'll definetly make sure to not overbake it next time. Though, it did smell a lot like strawberry it was good!<br/><br/>" +
            "I remember this day Buns was making Bho Ko (a vietnamese beef stew dish). Everyone came over to eat so I decided to try these brownies out. We also watched smile 1. The movie was actually pretty interesting.<br/><br/>" +
            "I would give this recipe a <strong>10/10</strong>. You just mix everything in a bowl then bake it. It's hard to mess up. Plus I like how you can modify the recipe by adding different protein powders and the type of chocolate. "

        "description": "Jiggle Wiggle",
        "bodyArticle": 
            "My first dessert recipe that has to use a stove top: <strong>Coconut Pandan Jelly</strong>. Did you know this recipe uses <strong>agar agar</strong>? I bet you don't know what that is. It's basically a vegetarian subsitute for gelatin. Aye Gar Gar.<br/><br/>" +
            "Pandan Jelly consist of pandan and coconut. The process was easy but also a bit frustrating. So I had to boil the coconut jelly and pandan then you pour each layer while waiting for the previous layer to solidify." +
            "The annoying part was that sometimes the layer would take a while to solidify, so the jelly in the pot would solidify while I was waiting. Which is okay since you can boil it to make it jelly again. I had to boil it 3 extra times. " +
            "It wasn't my favorite running in and out of Bun's backyard reboiling the jelly.<br/> <br/>" +
            "I did overboil the rest of the pandan so some of it went to waste. It was okay though since the container didn't have anymore space for the layers. So it wasn't a lost cause. <br/> <br/>" + 
            "The jelly came out looking really good. The layers were sticking and the shape really solidify. I don't like jelly so I made it for Buns since he was craving it. Btw he made Bun Bo Hue that day it was yummy. <br/> <br/>" +
            "Even though I don't like jelly I would give this recipe a <strong>8/10</strong>. It was easy to make but annoying since I had to reboil the layers when they solidify, but it was fun pouring the layers and seeing it jiggle."

        "bodyArticle": 
            "Cheesecake has always been one of my favorite desserts because it was so sweet and kind of cheesey in a way. So originally I was going to make mini pumpkin pies but Buns was telling me how its graham cracker crust." +
            "So cheesecake uses a graham cracker crust. So why not make cheesecake instead. So I did! <br/> <br/>" +
            "These mini blueberry cheesecakes were really good but they turned out even better after it has been refridgerated. Following the recipe, I made a total of 18 cups with a little bit extra. I think the recipe could make a total of <strong>20-25 cups</strong>. <br/><br/>" +
            "Like every other recipe you mix everything then bake it. I did mess up a little because I forget to leave out the creamcheese and all the other ingredients to <strong>room temperature</strong>. So I just let it sit in hot water and it turned out all good in the end. Definetly a lesson to remember next time <br/><br/>" +
            "The dessert was actually for our 2024 friendsgiving! That's why I want to make pumpkin pie because don't people eat pie on thanksgiving? But it's okay no one asked for it.<br/><br/>" +
            "I give this recipe a <strong>9/10</strong>. Only because I don't really like eating my blueberries in full form. Maybe it would have been good too if I squashed up the blueberries so the cheesecake would have been a dark blue color. Who knows?"

            "Ube has to be my favorite type of flavor. My first taste of ube was a halo halo at <strong>Cafe 86</strong>. Ube is a purple yam that is originally from the Philipphines. The taste is similar to taro but it's a bit sweeter.<br/><br/>" +
            "I think the hardest part about this recipe was looking for the jam and extract. I managed to find the jam at ranch 99 and the extract suprisingly at Walmart. It could also be found at another vietnamese store but I can't remember the name. The Hmart near me did not have any of these items.<br/><br/>" +
            "The jam gave it flavor, but the extract gave it so much color and much more flavor. Mixing it was my favorite part because the color turned out so nicely. I also like licking the spoon when I am finished mixing.<br/><br/>" +
            "So the color from mixing was amazing but after cooking, it wasn't looking so good. I don't know why but I tend to overcook everything. Maybe i'm just scared that i'll die from raw ingredients? The top of the brownies was a bit hard and it turned into like a dark brown color. " +
            "The chocolate chip also turned into a nasty yellow looking color. One thing I learned is that it's okay to take it out a <strong>little early because it will still slowly cook while it's super hot</strong>.<br/><br/>" +
            "The brownies tasted really good though. I definetly prefer it cold because it taste more like fudge and chunky. When it was reheated it would get super crumbly and the brownies don't stay in tact.<br/><br/>" +
            "Again, finding the ingredients is the hardest part. I would give this recipe a <strong>10/10</strong>. Mix and bake, then mix and bake! The <strong>unlikely baker</strong> has so much ube recipes that I need to try out."
